SeatLayer's official Ruby server SDK is the trusted side of its reserved seating and seat booking
API. Inspect what a hold really contains, price from server-owned seating-chart data, and book
with a stable `booking_ref`, while managing charts, events, inventory, allocations, and webhooks
through one typed ticketing API client.

## Scale evidence

SeatLayer is benchmarked on public 100,000-, 150,000- and 200,000-seat venue fixtures: 200,000 seats chart-ready in 1.95 s with 58 FPS zoom and 60 FPS pan in a desktop benchmark (15 September 2026).

## Install the Ruby seat booking SDK

```ruby
gem "seatlayer"
```

```bash
gem install seatlayer
```

Requires Ruby 3.0 or newer. **No runtime dependencies** — `net/http`, `json` and `openssl` from the
standard library.

## Quick start

```ruby
require "seatlayer"

client = SeatLayer::Client.new(ENV.fetch("SEATLAYER_SECRET_KEY"))

# 1. Provision a venue for a new organiser from a public template.
# Replace this placeholder with a template id from your catalog.
chart = client.templates.instantiate_template("your-published-template")["meta"]
client.charts.publish(chart["id"])

# 2. Create an event on it.
event = client.events.create(
  chart_id: chart["id"], name: "Spring Gala",
  currency: "EUR", # omit to inherit the workspace currency
  region: "western-europe" # India: "asia-pacific"
)["meta"]

# 3. Sell four seats over the phone.
held = client.inventory.hold_best_available(event["key"], qty: 4)
# … take payment against held["items"], which carry authoritative prices …
client.inventory.book(event["key"], hold_id: held["holdId"], booking_ref: "order-8842")
```

## Event hosting region

Pass `region:` to `events.create` based on the **event venue**, not your API server or office. It
controls the initial placement of the Event's live inventory; an existing Event
cannot be moved later. Omit it to inherit the workspace default (`western-europe` for new accounts).
Set that default with `workspaces.create(default_region: ...)` or
`workspaces.update(workspace_id, default_region: ...)`; changing it affects only future Events.

- `western-europe`, `eastern-europe`, `north-america-east`, `north-america-west`, `south-america`
- `asia-pacific`, `northeast-asia`, `southeast-asia`, `oceania`, `africa`, `middle-east`

The hint is best effort, not a data-residency guarantee. See the
[full Event region guide](https://docs.seatlayer.io/server-api/event-regions/).

Nullable event-create fields distinguish omission from an explicit reset: passing, for example,
`venue: nil` sends JSON `null`; leaving `venue` out sends no field.

## Fixed Renewable Seasons

Version `0.7.0` exposes all 48 trusted organizer operations through
`client.seasons`.

After the test hold/book/cancel journey and matching webhook deliveries,
`validate_season_buyer_rehearsal(season_key)` sends no evidence body; SeatLayer
discovers the retained chain automatically. Retrieved Season holds contain
inventory identity, not an authoritative amount—your platform owns package
price, payment, order, tax, refunds, benefits, and ticket or pass delivery.

```ruby
checked = client.seasons.validate_season(
  source_performance_group_keys: ["pg_subscription_run"]
)
draft = client.seasons.create_season(
  name: "2027 subscription",
  source_performance_group_keys: ["pg_subscription_run"],
  idempotency_key: "season-create-2027"
).fetch("season")
```

Treat `202` as accepted work and poll `retrieve_season_lifecycle` with the
returned operation identity. Buyer-session minting and domain-exact booking,
cancellation, and renewal actions remain single-attempt; only declared
header-replay catalogue mutations retry automatically.

## Test vs live

Keys carry their own mode. `sk_test_…` keys can only touch test-mode events and `sk_live_…` only
live ones; crossing them returns `403 mode_mismatch`, surfaced as `AuthError` with `mode_mismatch?`.

```ruby
client = SeatLayer::Client.new(ENV.fetch("SEATLAYER_SECRET_KEY"))
raise "Refusing to boot production against test-mode seating data." if
  ENV["RAILS_ENV"] == "production" && client.mode != "live"
```

A publishable `pk_` key is rejected at construction with a message naming the mistake, rather than
failing as a `401` three round-trips later.

## Book reserved seats from Ruby

**Buyer picks seats in the browser.** Your frontend holds them; your backend confirms the price and
books. Never price from what the browser sent you — `retrieve_hold` is authoritative.

```ruby
hold = client.inventory.retrieve_hold(event_key, hold_id)
currencies = hold["items"].map { |item| item.fetch("currency") }.uniq
raise "A hold must use one currency" unless currencies.one?

currency = currencies.first
total = hold["items"].sum do |item|
  item.fetch("unitPrice") * item.fetch("quantity", 1)
end
# … charge `total` in `currency` …
client.inventory.book(event_key, hold_id: hold_id, booking_ref: charge.id)
```

**Your backend picks the seats.** Phone orders, box office, comps.

```ruby
# Payment already taken — book outright, so nothing is stranded if a second call fails.
client.inventory.book_best_available(event_key, qty: 2, booking_ref: "phone-1183")

# Or name the seats yourself.
client.inventory.box_office_book(event_key, labels: ["A-1", "A-2"], booking_ref: "comp-14")
```

## Private and partner sales

Channels split event inventory into explicit allocations. A channel id is
reporting/routing metadata, not browser authority. Authenticate the buyer in
your backend and mint a short-lived token restricted to the event, origin, and
allowed allocations:

```ruby
access = client.channels.create_buyer_access_session(
  event_key,
  channel_ids: ["chn_partner_a"],
  include_public: false,
  allowed_origin: "https://tickets.example"
)
# Return access["token"] to the in-memory buyerAccessTokenProvider only.
```

Never log or persist the returned `bse_…` bearer. Allocation setup, previews,
pause/archive controls, audit-safe session listing, and channel reports are on
`client.channels`.

## Listing and pagination

`list` returns one page plus a `nextCursor`. `list_all` pages for you and returns a lazy
`Enumerator` when no block is given — the point of paginating is to *not* hold an unbounded result
set in memory, so `.lazy.first(n)` stops fetching once it has enough.

```ruby
# One page, your own paging.
page = client.events.list(limit: 50)
page["events"]
page["nextCursor"]   # nil once exhausted

# Or let the SDK walk it.
client.events.list_all do |event|
  sync(event)
end

# Lazily — this fetches one page, not all of them.
client.charts.list_all.lazy.first(5)
```

Listing events includes live availability `counts` by default, which costs the server one
round-trip **per event**. `list_all` turns them off automatically — walking a whole catalogue is
exactly when you don't want that — and you can control it explicitly:

```ruby
client.events.list(limit: 50, counts: false)
```

## Keeping a hold alive

When an order takes longer than the checkout window — an invoice, a phone sale — extend rather than
release and re-hold. Releasing first hands the seats to whoever is racing for them in between.

```ruby
begin
  client.inventory.extend_hold(event_key, hold_id, ttl_ms: 10 * 60_000)
rescue SeatLayer::ConflictError
  # Gone, expired, or at its renewal cap — the buyer has to re-pick.
end
```

## Embedding the control room

Your secret key never reaches a browser. Mint a scoped token instead.

```ruby
session = client.sessions.create_manage_session(
  event_key,
  allowed_origin: "https://box-office.yourplatform.com",
  capabilities: ["event:view", "event:block"],
  expires_in_seconds: 3600
)
```

`capabilities` is **required** by this SDK even though the raw API safely defaults an omitted list
to view-only (`event:view`). Keeping the argument required makes browser authority visible at every
call site. Grant the smallest set the page needs.

The full set, all opt-in:

| Capability | Grants |
|---|---|
| `event:view` | Read the seat map and its live states |
| `event:block` | Block and unblock seats |
| `event:cancel` | Cancel a Platform/SDK booking by reference and return its inventory to sale; does not move gateway money |
| `event:reports` | Read sales and availability reports |
| `event:channels:view` | Read sales channels and their allocations |
| `event:channels:manage` | Create, pause and archive channels; rotate access links |
| `event:orders:read` | Read SeatLayer-managed orders |
| `event:refund` | Refund an eligible Managed Ticketing order through its connected gateway |
| `event:tickets:send` | Send SeatLayer-managed tickets |
| `event:door:view` | Read the door list |
| `event:door:checkin` | Check tickets in and out |
| `event:boxoffice` | Use the managed box-office surface |

The two `event:channels:*` capabilities are **not** in the default — a token minted before sales
channels existed must not silently acquire channel authority — so ask for them explicitly if the
page manages channels.

Designer minting returns the API envelope unchanged: read the token and effective safe-mode and
feature policy under `result["session"]`. Pass `safe_mode_options` only with `mode: "safe"`.

## Webhooks

Subscription responses use the wire envelopes exactly: `list` returns `{"subs" => [...]}`,
`create` returns `{"sub" => ..., "secret" => ...}` (the secret is shown once), and `update`
returns `{"sub" => ...}`. `SeatLayer::Webhooks::EVENT_NAMES` is the exact eight-name event set;
delivery history accepts `limit`, `status` (`"ok"` or `"failed"`), and `before`.

Verify every delivery against the **raw** body. Re-encoding a parsed Hash changes the bytes and
verification will fail.

```ruby
# Rails
class WebhooksController < ApplicationController
  skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token

  def seatlayer
    event = SeatLayer::Webhook.verify(
      request.raw_post,                          # raw body, never params
      request.headers["X-SeatLayer-Signature"],
      ENV.fetch("SEATLAYER_WEBHOOK_SECRET")
    )

    # The signed body carries `at`, but nothing enforces a freshness window, so a
    # captured delivery stays valid indefinitely. Deduplicate on occurrenceId —
    # this is your replay protection, not an optimisation.
    return head :ok if already_processed?(event["occurrenceId"])

    Handler.call(event)
    head :ok
  rescue SeatLayer::WebhookVerificationError
    head :bad_request
  end
end
```

## Errors

```ruby
begin
  client.inventory.hold_best_available(event_key, qty: 6)
rescue SeatLayer::ConflictError => e
  return show_alternative_dates if e.sold_out?   # a business outcome, not a bug
  raise
rescue SeatLayer::RateLimitError => e
  return retry_after(e.retry_after)
rescue SeatLayer::AuthError => e
  raise "Test key pointed at a live event, or the reverse." if e.mode_mismatch?
  raise
end
```

| Class | Status | Means |
|---|---|---|
| `AuthError` | 401, 403 | Bad, revoked, or wrong-mode key |
| `NotFoundError` | 404 | No such resource *for this organisation* |
| `ConflictError` | 409 | Inventory moved, or a guard rejected the change |
| `ValidationError` | 422 | Understood and rejected |
| `RateLimitError` | 429 | Over budget; carries `retry_after` |
| `ConnectionError` | — | No answer: DNS, TLS, socket, timeout |

All descend from `SeatLayer::Error`, so `rescue SeatLayer::Error` catches everything. Every API
error carries `status`, `code`, `body` and `request_id` — quote the request id in support requests.

## Reliability

**Retries.** Reads (`GET`/`HEAD`) retry 429, 408 and 5xx with exponential backoff and full jitter;
`Retry-After` wins when the server sends it. Fourteen mutations use exact header replay:
`charts.create`, `charts.copy`, `templates.instantiate_template`, `events.create`,
`workspaces.create`, `performance_groups.create`, `seasons.create_season`,
`seasons.update_season`, `seasons.delete_season`, `seasons.create_season_plan`,
`seasons.duplicate_season_to_live`, `seasons.create_season_holder_import`,
`seasons.create_season_renewal_offers`, and `seasons.create_season_amendment`. Other 4xx responses
are never retried.

**Idempotency.** Those 14 replay-backed operations carry an `Idempotency-Key`, generated when you
do not supply one and reused across attempts. All remaining SDK mutations are single-attempt. Some
have a server-side domain idempotency contract, but the SDK does not retry them automatically. This
includes inventory holds and bookings, show-once credential or secret creation, unsupported
operations, and raw `request` mutations. Keep `booking_ref` in the booking body for reconciliation,
but handle an unknown network outcome explicitly instead of automatically repeating the sale.

```ruby
client.events.create(chart_id: chart_id, idempotency_key: "provision-event-#{event_id}")
```

```ruby
SeatLayer::Client.new(
  ENV.fetch("SEATLAYER_SECRET_KEY"),
  max_retries: 3,   # total attempts
  timeout: 30.0     # seconds, per attempt
)
```

## Escape hatch

For surface this SDK does not wrap yet, `request` keeps auth and error mapping. Raw reads retain the
read retry policy; raw mutations are always single-attempt because their replay contract is unknown:

```ruby
client.request("POST", "/v1/events/ev_1/some-new-route", body: { "qty" => 2 })
```

## API surface

The client exposes these resources. Performance Groups cover runs, sessions, holds, and bookings;
Seasons cover catalogue, plan, sales, buyer-session, booking, renewal, occurrence, reporting,
outbox, and support operations.

### Deliberately not in this SDK

Some API surface is intentionally unwrapped, not merely pending:

- **Hosted-checkout orders and refunds.** Reading or refunding a SeatLayer-hosted-checkout sale is
  not a server-SDK capability. Those records only exist for organisations using hosted checkout; if
  you run your own commerce store you refund in that store, through your own gateway.
- **Connecting or assigning payment gateways.** Connecting one is a dashboard flow, so shipping only
  the assignment half across seven SDKs would hand you a method that cannot yet succeed.
- **Realtime seat updates.** Live seat state reaches the *browser* through the widget's own socket.
  There is no server-side subscribe; a secret-key caller gets authoritative state from
  `events.retrieve_report` and `inventory.retrieve_availability`.

None of these are reachable through `request` as a supported path either — they are excluded from
the public manifest, not just from the wrapper.

## Frequently asked questions

### How do I book seats from Ruby?

Create a client with your secret key, obtain a hold id — either from the buyer's
browser session or by holding server-side — and call `inventory.book(event_key, hold_id: ..., booking_ref: ...)`.
`booking_ref` is your own stable order id and is the join between SeatLayer
inventory and your commercial order, so the same reference identifies the booking
in Booking History and when you later cancel it. For phone orders, box office, and
comps, `inventory.book_best_available` books outright with no browser involved.

### What does the server SDK do compared with the buyer SDK?

The buyer SDK runs where the ticket buyer is: it renders the interactive seating
chart, handles seat selection, and creates temporary holds. This server SDK is the
trusted side. It authenticates with your secret key, inspects what a hold actually
contains, prices from server-owned data, and books. Never bundle the secret key
into a browser or a mobile app — browser surfaces get short-lived, origin-bound
tokens that you mint here.

### How do temporary holds work server-side?

A hold reserves seats against concurrent buyers for a limited window.
`inventory.retrieve_hold(event_key, hold_id)` is the authoritative answer for what is held
and at what price, so charge from its `items` rather than from anything the browser
sent you. When an order runs longer than the checkout window, `inventory.extend_hold`
renews the hold instead of releasing and re-holding, which would hand the seats to
whoever is racing for them. Bookings carry the server's exact-selection plus
`booking_ref` safeguard, but the SDK sends each booking once — reconcile an unknown
outcome before trying again.

### Can I use my own payment provider?

Yes. This server SDK does not process payment in a Platform/SDK integration. Inspect the hold,
compute the charge from each returned item's authoritative `unitPrice`, `quantity`, and `currency`,
take the money through whichever provider you already use, and then book the hold with your order
id as `booking_ref`. SeatLayer owns seating state, holds, booking concurrency, and the inventory
ledger in this integration; your platform owns payments, commercial orders, tickets, delivery,
and refunds. Managed Ticketing is a separate product path with organizer-connected payments.
